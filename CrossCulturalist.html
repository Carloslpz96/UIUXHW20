        <p>“My rule of thumb is that if there laws do not have rights for people of LGBTQIA+ expression, then it is not a place where i need to be, “</p>

            <h3>ROADTRIPPERS ANALYSIS</h3>
            <div id="roadtrippersanalysisdiv" style="display: inline-flex; padding-right: 380px; align-items="center">
            <p>Roadtripper offers a seamless initiation process for trip planning. Distinguished by its visually appealing interface and user-friendly design, the app ensures a hassle-free experience. Registration is simplified, requiring only your email address, Facebook, or Apple account. Once these details are provided, you gain immediate access to initiate trip planning effortlessly.The website and application feature a visually appealing design, with icons representing iconic stops throughout the U.S. The process entails entering your departure and destination points, resulting in the automatic creation of a tailored trip itinerary. Furthermore, users can fine-tune their preferences for experiences along the route, resulting in the creation of a well-structured road trip itinerary presented in an elegant and organized manner.</p>

            <img src="images/CrossCulturalistPage/image 13.png">
        </div>
        <p style="margin-right: 380px;">Roadtripper does not heavily emphasize user customization within its app. The information that can be provided is limited to user profiles, social media connections, and vehicle ownership details. While this information primarily facilitates the ability to leave reviews of destinations and connect with friends, the app offers limited avenues for users to engage with one another.</p>
        </div>
       
        <div id="googletravelanalysis" style="padding-right: 350px;">
            <h3>GOOGLE TRAVEL ANALYSIS</h3>
            <img src="images/CrossCulturalistPage/image 15.png">
            <p>Google's brand stands as an internet icon, akin to how Kleenex is synonymous with tissues. The company's omnipresence extends across various domains within the internet sphere. Their travel application is distinguished by its streamlined design and remarkable efficiency in information delivery. Significantly, the app imposes no sign-up process for Google Account users, leveraging the wide user base of Gmail accounts, which essentially means users are already logged in when they access Google Travel.
            </p>
            <img src="images/CrossCulturalistPage/Screenshot 2024-02-04 at 3.12 1.png">
            <p>Opting to begin exploration from the homepage leads the user to a page reminiscent of Roadtrippers' interface, with the added convenience of immediate pricing information. The user interface maintains Google's signature cleanliness and ease of interaction. However, in contrast to some other Google products, Google Travel lacks a feature suggesting destinations to the user; instead, it encourages user-driven exploration. While users can zoom in for a more detailed view of places, the app does not actively propose destinations, placing the onus of discovery squarely on the user.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="expediaanalysis" style="padding-right: 350px;">
            <h3>EXPEDIA ANALYSIS</h3>
            <p>Expedia's application stands out for its comprehensive array of features, offering users an unparalleled level of precision when it comes to filtering results according to their unique preferences. It encompasses a wide range of options, covering flights, accommodations, travel packages, and various activities. However, areas where Expedia faces challenges include its user interface (UI) and overall usability, both of which could benefit from improvement.</p>
            <img src="images/CrossCulturalistPage/Screenshot 2024-02-04 at 3.18 1.png">

            <img src="images/CrossCulturalistPage/Screenshot 2024-02-04 at 3.19 2.png">
            <p>Expedia boasts a diverse range of stay options, leveraging its ownership of Hotels.com and Vrbo. This extensive offering encompasses hotels, resorts, and vacation homes available for rental, providing users with a broad spectrum of choices. Expedia's overarching aim is to serve as a comprehensive destination for all travel-related requirements, thereby retaining users throughout the entire trip planning process. 

            The registration process is straightforward, requiring minimal information such as email and name, making it a hassle-free entry point to the website</p> </div>

        <h3>COMPETITOR ANALYSIS CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p style="padding-right: 350px;">While existing online travel platforms offer thorough but somewhat impersonal experiences, Cross-Culturalist is poised to redefine travel as a social endeavor, aligning with the public sphere concept exemplified by apps like Letterboxd and Goodreads. It serves as a platform for individuals to publicly chronicle their travel journeys, enabling others to gain insights into their destinations, provide reviews, and discover new places in an engaging and cohesive manner. Users can seamlessly explore algorithmically categorized destinations, akin to swiping left or right, and share their travel experiences with their friends, fostering a dynamic and interactive travel community.</p>

        <h3>KEY LEARNING FROM USER TESTS</h3>
        <p style="padding-right: 350px;" >Upon conducting user tests within the Cross-Culturalist app, significant design issues became evident. While the app's success was intended to stem from its simplicity and user-friendly interface, critical elements were overlooked. Specifically, the absence of a log-out button and the lack of a consistent navigation pathway, including the absence of a back button on every page, posed notable challenges. Several sections within the app resembled long corridors without the option to backtrack, causing a usability bottleneck. While the app's fundamental concept was robust, these navigation shortcomings underscored the necessity for refined design and improved user experience.</p>

    <h1 style="color: black;">FINAL THOUGHTS</h1>
    <h3>Target Audience and Project Vision</h3>
    <p>Initially conceived as a tool to broaden perspectives, this app was designed with individuals who had limited exposure to diverse cultures in mind, especially those hesitant to step out of their comfort zones. The context of a shrinking global perspective due to the COVID-19 pandemic further fueled the project. However, during user interviews, a critical realization occurred. The focus needed to shift towards marginalized groups, individuals who often felt unsafe even within their own communities. This revelation emphasized the importance of understanding the unique challenges faced by these communities, reshaping the app's purpose.</p>
    <h3>Guerilla Testing and Continuous Improvement</h3>
    <p>The development process of CrossCulturalist was marked by a deep passion for design and constant refinement. While guerilla testing played a crucial role, a tendency to preemptively tweak elements before receiving comprehensive feedback emerged. This introspective realization highlighted the need for a more structured approach to testing methodologies. Future endeavors will undoubtedly integrate refined interviewing and testing techniques to enhance the app's effectiveness.</p>
    <h3>Mission and Cultural Connection</h3>
    <p>At its core, CrossCulturalist stands as a testament to my personal journey, deeply rooted in my Cuban heritage and second-generation immigrant identity. Growing up amidst a mosaic of diverse cultures profoundly influenced my perspective. Recognizing the prevalence of ignorance in homogeneous communities, the app was conceptualized as a tool for education and community building. It aims to bridge gaps, fostering respect and love for all cultures. Travel, as eloquently stated by Anthony Bourdain, is a transformative force, leaving indelible marks on both the traveler and the places they explore. CrossCulturalist, inspired by this philosophy, strives to facilitate meaningful connections, provide cultural insights, and contribute to a world where understanding and acceptance reign.</p>
